# admin-dashboard

A layout developed for the admin dashboard that allows users (with admin privileges) to view and manage their coding projects. The design is inspired by the old Twitter layout. 

At the moment, the project is not fully responsive but I am planning to revisit it at a later stage to implement that functionality.

Made with HTML and CSS only.
